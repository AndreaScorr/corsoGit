Research track 1 
Andrea Scorrano
====================
This is the first assignment of Research Track:

Write a python node that controls the robot to put all the golden boxes together.

Installing and running
----------------------

The simulator requires a Python 2.7 installation, the [pygame](http://pygame.org/) library, [PyPyBox2D](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypybox2d/2.1-r331), and [PyYAML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML/).

Pygame, unfortunately, can be tricky (though [not impossible](http://askubuntu.com/q/312767)) to install in virtual environments. If you are using `pip`, you might try `pip install hg+https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame`, or you could use your operating system's package manager. Windows users could use [Portable Python](http://portablepython.com/). PyPyBox2D and PyYAML are more forgiving, and should install just fine using `pip` or `easy_install`.

## How to Run the code
To run one or more scripts in the simulator, use `run.py`, passing it the file names. 

In this case write this line on the terminal:

```bash
$ python2 run.py assignment.py
```
